Read in the data, create **date** as date class, and filter to keep the
first quarter of 1969 through the 4th quarter of 2010. The data is in
the file "EconMood_v3.xls."

```{r}
#install.packages("gdata")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gdata))
library(haven)

data = read_dta("/Users/alex/Downloads/UK Parties (1).dta")



data$date <- as.Date(paste(data$year, data$monthofyear, "1", sep = "/"))





```

We need either a ts class data object or a zoo class for the `dynlm()`
function. I've done both here and will use the zoo class data frame in
what follows. The advantage of zoo class is that you can add variables
in the same manner as a data frame.

# Plot the Time Series

```{r, message=FALSE}
data.ts <- ts(data, start = c(1997,5), end = c(2010, 4), frequency = 12)
data.ts2 <- as.zooreg(data.ts)

data$date <- as.Date(paste(data$year, data$monthofyear, "1", sep = "/"))

df <- data %>%
  select(date, mvilab, mgvldrsat, moppldrsat, meoi) %>%
  gather(key = "series", value = "value", -date)

```

```{r}



ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = value)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = series), size = 1) +
   scale_x_date(date_breaks = "24 month", date_labels = "%b\n%Y")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "green","yellow", "red"), name = "", 
  labels =  c("Labor Vote Intention", "PM Approval", "Opposition Approval", "Economic Optimism")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  labs(title="",
       x="Month", 
       y="", 
       subtitle="May 1997 through April 2010")


```

Each of the series appears to deviate from its mean value for extended
periods of time, suggestive of random walks. The figure might also
suggest that public policy mood is in sync with economic expectations
and inversely related to policy outcomes, as theorized.

# Conduct Unit Root Tests

Use the DF test to determine whether variables are unit root processes. 

# Is mvilab a Unit Root Process?
I assume $D_t=c$,
$pmax = 8$, and test for serial correlation over 12 lags.

```{r}
adf.tests(data$mvilab, pmax = 8, lmtestorder = 12, type = "constant")

```

Choose $p$ for test regression.

-   All LM p >0.05, no serial correlation

-   Could choose 1 or 2 based on AIC and BIC.

-   t all smaller than 1.60 

Here I will estimate the model with $p=2$, and rerun the model 

```{r}
adf.tests(data$mvilab, pmax = 2, lmtestorder = 12, type = "constant")
```


We cannot reject the unit root null, therefore it is very likely that Labor Vote intention is a unit root process. 



# Is mgvldrsat (PM approval) a Unit Root Process?

I again assume $D_t=c$,
$pmax = 8$, and test for serial correlation over 12 lags.


```{r}
adf.tests(data$mgvldrsat, pmax = 8, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")
```

Choose $p$ for test regression.

-   t value suggests we pick lags = 2

-   Could choose 2 based on AIC.

No evidence of serial correlation. Estimate the model with p = 2
$p=2$.

```{r}
adf.tests(data$mgvldrsat, pmax = 2, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")
```

We fail to reject the null of a unit root. Therefore, mgvldrsat is a unit root process. 

# Is moppldrsa a Unit Root Process?

```{r}
adf.tests(data$moppldrsat, pmax = 8, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")

```


Choose $p$ for test regression.

-   t < 1.60 for all lags

-   Could choose 3 based on AIC.

No evidence of serial correlation when  lag > 0. Estimate the model with p = 3

```{r}

adf.tests(data$moppldrsat, pmax = 3, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")


```


We fail to reject the null of a unit root when lag = 3. Therefore, moppldrsat is a unit root process. 

# Is meoi a unit root process?

```{r}

adf.tests(data$meoi, pmax = 12, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")
```
-   From  t value wen can select  lag = 6
-   From AIC we can also select lag = 6

rerunning the test with lag = 6:

```{r}
adf.tests(data$meoi, pmax = 6, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")
```
p < 0.05 when lag = 6, the unit root null is only rejected when lag = 6 and lag = 0. LM p-value > 0.05, therefore we can reject serial correlation.  Let's rerun with two lags since t value suggest we can pick lag = 2. 

```{r}

adf.tests(data$meoi, pmax = 2, lmtestorder=12, type="constant")

```
We cannot reject unit root. Therefore, it is very likely that this is a unit root process (though not entirely sure).



# Engle-Granger Step 1

## Estimate a Cointegrating Regression

$$
Vote_t = D_{lr} + \lambda_1 PM\_Approval_t + \lambda_2 Oppo\_Approval_t + \lambda_3 Econ\_Opti_t + \mu_t
$$


-  Theoretically, vote intention should not include a trend, thus we want to include a
    constant, $\lambda_0$ to e our $D_{lr}$

-   A trend makes little sense (no series is drifting/trending), so we
    will not include it in the test regression.

$$
Mood_t = \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 filtbf_t + \lambda_2 PolAvg_t + \mu_t
$$

Estimate the cointegrating regression:

```{r}
model1 <- dynlm(mvilab ~ mgvldrsat +  moppldrsat + meoi, data=data.ts2)
summary(model1)

```

--We cannot conduct hypothesis tests on individual
coefficients in this regression!

## Test Residuals for Cointegration

Having estimated the cointegrating regression, our next task is to
determine whether the residuals are stationary. Thus, we test for cointegration using a
unit root test applied to the residuals from the cointegrating
regression. We will use a Dickey-Fuller test, but we could use other
unit root tests as well.



```{r}
adf.tests(model1$residuals, pmax = 12, lmtestorder = 12, type = "none")

```

Eight lags seems a good choice based on the t-statistic
on the highest lagged difference. AIC/BIC choose lag = 1. 

I rerun the test with $pmax=8$ 

```{r}
adf.tests(model1$residuals, pmax = 8, lmtestorder = 12, type = "none")

length(data$meoi)
```

The value of our test statistic is -2.490 for p = 8.

### Critical values of Dickey Fuller Test
 We need 3 pieces of information to use the table:

1.  Which test statistic, i.e., which table of critical values? Because
    the static regression included only a constant, we will use Table 2 and
    consider $\tau_c$.
2.  $n$. For the residual-based test we use the case where $N$ is the
    number of $I(1)$ variables for which the null of no cointegration is
    being tested (3). In our case, N = 3.
3.  $T$. $T$ is the sample size used for the cointegrating regression
    which is 156.

We will use the 0.05 critical value.

To compute the critical value we use the formula:
$\beta_{\infty} + \beta_/T + \beta_/T^2 + \beta_/T^3$, where
$\beta_{\infty}$ is the asymptotic critical value given the form of the
test regression and the remaining $\beta_i$ are used to correct based on
sample size. $T$


1.  Find the appropriate table based on whether there is a constant or
    constant and trend in the test regression (Here just constant, table
    2).
2.  Find row for N=3. We will use alpha level of .05. Note the various
    $\beta$ values. -3.74066 , -8.5631, -10.852, 27.982.
3.  Sample size $T$: $T=156$.
4.  Calculate the following formula for the approximate critical value:
    $q(T_i) = \beta_{\infty} + \beta_1(T_i)^{-1} + \beta_2(T_i)^{-2} - \beta_3(T_i)^{-3}$.

$-3.74066 - 8.5631/156 -10.852/(156^2) + 27.982/(156^3) = âˆ’3.799406$ based on numbers from the table. 


The test statistic value is -2.490. Thus, we fail to reject the null of
no cointegration, i.e., we fail to reject the null that the residuals
follow a unit root process at the 0.05 level of significance and thus
conclude the series are not cointegrated. 


## Dynamic OLS



$$
y_t = D_{lr} + \lambda_{1} x_{1t} + \lambda_{2} x_{2t} + ...+\lambda_{n} x_{nt} + \sum_{j=1}^n  \sum_{s=1}^r \eta_{js} \Delta x_{jt\pm s} +\mu_t
$$

where $r$ is large enough to ensure the regressors are not correlated
with the error. Including the additional lag and lead terms soaks up the
long-run correlation between the regressors and the errors. As a result,
the bias in the estimates of the long-run relationship tend to be
smaller in DOLS than in the static cointegrating regression. Moreover,
we can test restrictions on the cointegrating vector using Newey-West
heteroscedastic and autocorrelation consistent standard errors.

I've estimated this equation setting $r=2$ and $r=4$.

```{r}


myDOLS_2<- dynlm(mvilab ~ mgvldrsat +  L(d(mgvldrsat),c(-1, -2, 1, 2)) + moppldrsat + L(d(moppldrsat),c(-1, -2, 1, 2)) + meoi + L(d(meoi),c(-1, -2, 1, 2)), data=data.ts2)

myDOLSHAC_2 <- coeftest(myDOLS_2, vcov = vcovHAC(myDOLS_2))
```

```{r}
myDOLS_4<- dynlm(mvilab~ mgvldrsat +  moppldrsat + meoi +  L(d(mgvldrsat),c(-1, -2, -3, -4, 1, 2,3,4)) + L(d(moppldrsat),c(-1, -2, -3, -4, 1, 2,3,4)) + L(d(meoi),c(-1, -2, -3, -4, 1, 2,3,4)), data=data.ts2)
myDOLSHAC_4 <- coeftest(myDOLS_4, vcov = vcovHAC(myDOLS_4))


stargazer(myDOLSHAC_2, myDOLSHAC_4, type = "latex")
```

From the table we can see that all three variables are part of the cointegration.



# Engle-Granger Step 2

Cointegration implies that the any disequilibrium should drive **Vote**
to change to restore the long-run cointegrating
relationship/equilibrium. Thus, in step two we estimate an error
correction model in which changes in **Vote** are a function of the
long-run disequilibrium in the previous period, $\hat{\mu}_t$ and
contemporaneous changes in the independent variables. The form of this
regression is an ECM.

Before we estimate the ECM, we need to determine $D_{sr}$. In this case, $D_{sr} = c$. 

We'll also test for serial correlation in the residuals, but it is
important to note that this regression should meet all the TS regression
assumptions.

```{r}

mystatic2 <- dynlm(mvilab~ mgvldrsat +  moppldrsat + meoi, data=data.ts2)

data.ts2$static.DISEQ <- mystatic2$residuals


second.step <- dynlm(d(mvilab)~ L(static.DISEQ)  + d(mgvldrsat) + d(moppldrsat) + d(meoi) +  L(d(mgvldrsat),1) + L(d(moppldrsat),1) + L(d(mvilab),1) + L(d(mvilab),4)+ L(d(mvilab),8), data=data.ts2)

summary(second.step)
bgtest(second.step, order=4)
bgtest(second.step, order=8)
bgtest(second.step, order=12)
checkresiduals(second.step)
```
B-G test have p values > 0.05, cannot rejected the hypothesis that there are no serial correlation. Therefore, this model is adequate. checkresiduals() also shows that residuals are white noise. 




# GECM t-test


To conduct the ECM $t$-test for cointegration, we estimate the
generalized error correction model:

$$\Delta y_t = D_t -\alpha_1^* y_{t-1}-\beta_1^* x_{1t-1} - \beta_2^* x_{2t-1} -  â€¦ - \beta_n^* x_{nt-1} +  \psi_{1}\Delta x_{1t} + \psi_{2}\Delta x_{2t} + â€¦, \psi_{j}\Delta x_{jt}+ \varepsilon_t$$



$$\Delta Vote_t = D_t -\alpha_1^* Vote_{t-1} - \beta_1^* PM\_Approval_{t-1} + \beta_2^*Oppo\_Approval_{t-1} + \beta_3*Econ\_Opti_{t-1} +  \\ \psi_{1}\Delta Vote_{t} + 
\psi_{2}\Delta PM\_Approval_{t} +  \psi_{3}\Delta Oppo\_Approval_{t} + \psi_{4}\Delta Vote_{t-1} + \psi_{5}\Delta Vote_{t-4}+ \psi_{6}\Delta Vote_{t-8} +\varepsilon_t
$$


```{r}



GECMHAC <- coeftest(GECM, vcov = vcovHAC(GECM))# Heteroscedastic and 

bgtest(GECM, order =4)
bgtest(GECM, order =8)
bgtest(GECM, order =12)

checkresiduals(GECM)

```

Probably I added more terms than needed, but from the results we can see that there are not serial correlation and the residuals are white noise. 


Let's look at the results. I've asked `stargazer()` to print the
$t$-statistics, since this is our test statistic.

```{r}
stargazer(GECM, type="latex",type = "text",
          dep.var.labels = "Sentiment",
          report = "vct*",
          column.labels = "GECM")

```

Our test statistic is the $t$-statistic on $\hat{\alpha_1^*}$ in the
GECM (the coefficient on lagged **Vote**) and is -4.886


## Critical Values for the GECM $t$-test

Our interest in this test regression is on the t-statistic on lagged
**VOte**, $\alpha_1^*$. Using the MacKinnon's table again, we choose table 3, k = 3, 0.05 critical value. 


1.  Find appropriate table based on whether there is a constant and
    trend (here just constant, table 3).
    
2.  Find row for k equal to number of $I(1)$ independent variables. We
    have 3 will use alpha level of .05. Note the various $\theta$
    values: âˆ’3.7592 -2.92 âˆ’3.7 âˆ’5  .
3.  Compute adjusted sample size $T_a$: $T -(2*k-1) -d$:
    155-(2\*4-1)-1=147.
    
    
    
4.  Calculate following formula for approximate critical value:
    $q(T_i) = \theta_{\infty} + \theta_1(T_i)^{-1} + \theta_2(T_i)^{-2} - \theta_3(T_i)^{-3}$.

$$
    âˆ’3.7592âˆ’2.92âˆ—147^{-1}âˆ’3.7âˆ—149^{-2}âˆ’5âˆ—149^{-3}=âˆ’3.779232.
$$

The $t$-statistic on $\hat{\alpha_1^*}$ in the GECM (the coefficient on
lagged **Vote**) is -4.886, which is further from zero than the critical
value. We could reject the null of no cointegration if there were not
interventions. 



## Compare GECM with ECM


```{r}


stargazer(model1, second.step, GECMHAC, type = "text",
          dep.var.labels=c("Vote", "DeltaVote", "DeltaVote"),
          dep.var.caption = "",
          model.names = FALSE,
          column.labels=c("1st-step", "Two-Step ECM", "GECM"))



```


in our two-step ECM model, we can see that only d(mgvldrsat), Prime minister's approval rate, is statistically significant. 1 unit increase in in the PM Approval rates leads to 0.334% increase in labor vote in the same period. 


In GECM model, PM Approval is also statistically significant. Its effect is 0.333. 1 unit increase in in the PM Approval rates leads to 0.333% increase in labor vote in the same period. 



# Long Run Multiplier




In ECM model, the long run multiplier for PM Approval is 0.445, which suggests that every 1% increase in PM approval rate leads to a 0.445% increase in Labor Vote. Similarly, the LRM for Leader of Opposition Approval (moppldrsa) is -0.354, while the LRM for economic optimism index is -0.051. 


In GECM model, 


In one-step GECM model, the coefficient for $\hat{\alpha_1^*}$  is âˆ’0.564, the LRM for PM Approval is therefore,  âˆ’0.254/(âˆ’0.564)=0.450. LRM for Leader of Opposition Approval (moppldrsa) is 0.225/(âˆ’0.564)=âˆ’0.399. LRM for Economic Optimism Index is 0.017/âˆ’0.564= âˆ’0.0301

LRM for both models are fairly similar and all significant, with only LRM for Economic Optimism Index is slightly different between two models.

#Error correction coeff 



In ECM model, the error correction rate is -0.557.

In GECM model, the error correction rate is -0.564.

Therefore, 55% to 56% of the data are corrected in each period. I would say this process is fairly quick.
